# **Leetcode Practice**

Welcome to my LeetCode Practice Repository! ðŸš€

Here, I am consistently solving coding problems from LeetCode to sharpen my skills in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Problem Solving.

ðŸ“š **What's Inside**
âœ… Solutions to problems in Python (or any other language you're using).

âœ… Organized by problem type (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Dynamic Programming, etc.)

âœ… Clear and readable code with comments for understanding.

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**
Build strong problem-solving skills

Prepare for coding interviews

Master common patterns and techniques

Track and showcase my progress over time

ðŸš€ **Progress**
I am continuously adding new solutions as I practice daily. Stay tuned!
Feel free to explore, learn, and suggest better approaches if you find any!

Would you like me to also give you a fancier version (with badges, progress bars, etc.) if you want to make it âœ¨ more stylish?
(It's just a quick upgrade if you want your repo to look super professional too!) ðŸš€
